# Welcome to bubl-ai:
## llamaindex-project

All [bubl-ai repositories](https://github.com/bubl-ai) will have the same structure:

- **bubls:** Think of this as the source code of our repository, containing all the importable classes and functionalities. These are the fundamental building blocks, or bubls, that will serve as the foundation for crafting new creations!

- **builders:** So, what's the best thing to do with these bubls? Correct! Build whatever your imagination and creativity guide you to. This folder is intended for full workflows.

- **examples:** This is our sandbox where you can test different ideas and just let your imagination guide you. This folder purpose is to use current bubls and to help on the creation of new ones.

- **data:** Will include a few small toy datasets here. The full set of datasets to play with will be available in our [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bubl-ai) page.

- [**Docker:**](https://bubl-ai.com/posts/Simple-Dockerfile-for-Dev-Purposes/) For us, having a fully operational Docker container is pivotal. This container is the foundation for consistency, reproducibility and collaboration

- [**setup.py:**](https://bubl-ai.com/posts/Repo-as-Importable-Package/) We ensure that our code in the repository can be effortlessly updated and readily available within our development container, just like any other installed package. We strongly believe that being equipped with this setup places any developer in an ideal position. It transforms innovation into the primary focus, allowing us to bid farewell to errors associated with a subpar environment setup.
