This is the point where everything clicks into place.

In our [initial post](https://bubl-ai.com/posts/Raspberry-Pi-Setup/) of this series, we delved into setting up our computer (a Raspberry Pi 5 in our case). The primary goals were to establish a consistent and reproducible environment, fostering agile development, and encouraging collaboration.

For us, having a fully operational Docker container is pivotal. This container must seamlessly connect to our GitHub repository. In our second installment, [Simple Dockerfie for Dev Purposes](https://bubl-ai.com/posts/Simple-Dockerfile-for-Dev-Purposes/) , we covered precisely that.

[In third and final post](https://bubl-ai.com/posts/Repo-as-Importable-Package/), we ensured that our code in the repository could be effortlessly updated and readily available within our development container, just like any other installed package.

We strongly believe that being equipped with this setup places any developer in an ideal position. It transforms innovation into the primary focus, allowing us to bid farewell to errors associated with a subpar environment setup. 

Now, let's delve into what you'll discover in the bubl-ai repositories, such as the [*llamaindex-project*](https://github.com/bubl-ai/llamaindex-project):

- **bubls**: Think of this as the source code of our repository, containing all the importable classes and functionalities. These are the fundamental building blocks, or bubls, that will serve as the foundation for crafting new creations!

- **builders**: So, what's the best thing to do with these building blocks? Correct! Build whatever your imagination and creativity guide you to.
