This example is inspired by a project by **techwithtim**. You can find the original code [here](https://github.com/techwithtim/AI-Agent-Code-Generator/tree/main). For a detailed explanation, I recommend watching [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLmI0GJuGlY).

I've made some significant changes to the original code:
- I am leveraging the bubl-ai structure and defining importable functions within it.
- The code has been refactored and encapsulated within a self-contained and executable class.
- I've added retry functionality as a wrapper.

To try out this example, simply run `python main.py`.
